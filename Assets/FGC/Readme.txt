Welcome To The Freedom's Gate Characters (FGC)


********************************************
************** GETTING STARTED *************
********************************************
it's all very easy

1) Open the demo scene that you will find inside the package

2) Start and try first simple animations

3) Test the blendshape.

4) For add hairs and cloths you can use add Item script; I improved the weight-map of cloth included (Wagsuit), but I always recommend you to use the alpha texture included and set rendering mode to "Cutout"

5) Video links useful to better understand how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JCVMSpoO24&list=PLeIqGmCk1EICV8HxSCbMhXAk4qWosaQGH

FGC Male Adam is a free-package to test my new blendshapes that allow the customization face of my 3d character. These blendsapes will soon be incorporated in some my FG-Characters. I kindly ask you to evaluate this product and place your rating. Also expect your advice to help me improve my proposals. 
Thank you.
